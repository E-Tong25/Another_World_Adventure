# Another_World_Adventure
My project is a text-based, "choose-your-own-adventure" game that has an isekai and greek mythology theme. 

The player starts the game by entering into a new world, after being reincarnated. 
The player can name themselves, which is stored and used within the program. 
The player is then directed by an omnicient being named Q, who has a snarky personality.
The player goes on quests, fights enemies, joins a guild and so much more.
